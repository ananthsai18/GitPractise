Earlier i was an angry person ,arrogant who never listens to other persons words i want to change may be i changed now , now i was cooler than before no anger 
controlling my nerves also very hesitant to scold someone had fear of they might get hurt. Now i am changing but lets wait see , they are 
behavioural traits, they might trigger in future in difficult curcumstances ,at that time i need to stay quiet and hold my nerve.
